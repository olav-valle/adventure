program structure:

   +Main
    +-- Game
        +-- Character
        +-- Item
        +-- Area

    Game holds all game world objects; characters (including player character), world areas and items.
    Items, areas and NPC's are held in HashMap<ID, OBJECT>, where ID is some identifier
    (probably strings, i.e. name), and OBJECT is the object type (Item, Area, Character etc).

    Character objects track their current location (an Area), and their inventory (HashMap of Item objects).
    Where relevant, a character will also track their stats (int, str, etc.), and eventually dialogue
    and event triggers
